# The Journey from Nothing to Something

Three months ago, I was bored in quarantine and decided to pick up drawing. What I didn't know is that this would turn out to be a way to express my ideas onto a digital canvas as well as a way I could possibly earn money.

Funny enough, what motivated me to start this little experiment was that I got a 70% on an english project, which I drew. Of course, the art wasn't a big part of it, but I couldn't help but believe that it did contribute to that dissapointing grade. So, I got working.

# Dragons! I really like drawing dragons for some apparent reason. Here are some cool firey boys!
